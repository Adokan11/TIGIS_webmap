                <p>
                    The aim of this project is to identify which historic buildings in Edinburgh’s greenspace would 
                    be most suitable to retrofit for community use. Community centres in greenspaces address 
                    environmental deprivation by providing accessible social infrastructure where people 
                    experience nature, reducing isolation in areas lacking quality environmental amenities.
                    However, their benefits are often overlooked in community and heritage schemes. Therefore, 
                    we aim to examine the value of Edinburgh’s greenspaces by assessing their potential to serve 
                    as community hubs while preserving and enhancing their historic and cultural significance.

                <h2>2. Analytical Hierarchy Processing Steps</h2>
                <p>
                    To develop the weighting and prioritisation rubric for scoring sites, we applied the Analytical 
                    Hierarchy Process (AHP) using the criteria below. Information from our literature review, as 
                    well as our own judgments and evaluations were used to complete the AHP. The results are 
                    shown below:

    <h2>3. Interpreting the Map</h2>

    <p>
        The TIGIS webmap combines several spatial layers and interactive tools to help users explore 
        historic sites, nearest green spaces and community centres across Edinburgh. The guidance 
        below explains how to interpret the visualisation and the indicators shown on the map.
    </p>

    <div class="interpret_grid">
        <div class="interpret_card">
            <h3>3.1 Layers</h3>
            <p>
                The map includes five main layers:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sites:</strong> Candidate locations for suitability. Each site contains
                    attributes such as proximity to community centres, buffer zone, SIMD rank and 
                    nearest green space.</li>
                <li><strong>Buffers:</strong> Circular catchments representing a site’s effective service area.
                    Buffer population counts are used as part of the suitability scoring.</li>
                <li><strong>Green Spaces:</strong> Greenspace polygons classified into several categories
                    (e.g., park, play area, natural space). These are used both as map context and as part of
                    the Greenspace Type criterion.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Centres:</strong> Point locations representing community facilities used in
                    the proximity analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>SIMD Ranks:</strong> SIMD (Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation) ranks are included 
                    to show how deprivation varies across Edinburgh. Lower ranks represent more deprived areas.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="interpret_card">
            <h3>3.2 Colour Schemes</h3>
            <p>
                Site markers can be coloured according to their final ranking. When the
                Colour by Rank option is enabled, lower ranking sites appear in darker colours while
                higher ranking sites appear in lighter tones. This helps users quickly identify the most 
                suitable locations fro our analysis.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="interpret_card">
            <h3>3.3 Filters</h3>
            <p>
                Several filters allow users to refine which sites are displayed:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Final Score Range:</strong> Adjust the minimum and maximum AHP score to view only
                    sites within a chosen suitability band.</li>
                <li><strong>Buffer Population:</strong> Limit sites to those serving a minimum or maximum
                    population within their buffer catchment.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Centre Distance:</strong> Show sites that fall within a specific distance
                    range from a community centre.</li>
                <li><strong>Greenspace Type Filter:</strong> Display only sites associated with selected
                    types of greenspaces.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="interpret_card">
            <h3>3.4 Searching</h3>
            <p>
                The search function allows users to locate specific sites by name or reference code.
                When a site is selected from the search, the map zooms to its location and displays the
                full attribute panel for closer inspection.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="interpret_card">
            <h3>3.5 Interaction Tools</h3>
            <p>
                Clicking on a site opens a detailed information panel showing:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Final suitability score and contributing criteria values</li>
                <li>Population within the buffer zone</li>
                <li>Distance to nearest community centre</li>
                <li>Associated greenspace type</li>
